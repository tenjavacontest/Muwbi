PokeballZ

Idea
---
The basic idea is very simple. Using so called 'Pokeballs' you can catch mobs and store them in your bag or whereever you want.
Commands
---
/pokeball - Gives you a Pokeball
Usage
---
Throw your Pokeball to catch a mob. There is a chance to fail, so sometimes you have to use more than one ball ;)
Once you've caught the mob, you receive a monster egg containing it.
Right-click to respawn it and throw another Pokeball to catch it again (100% chance to catch it)
Development
---
The actual development time was about 2-3 hours, the rest of the time I played World of Warcraft :D
